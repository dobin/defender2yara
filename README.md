## Original Acknowledgments / Reference by defender2yara

This project would not have been possible without the valuable resources and insights provided by the following:

- **GitHub - commial/experiments** and **Windows Defender: Demystifying and Bypassing ASR by Understanding the AVS Signatures**: A special thanks to the author of the [commial/experiments](https://github.com/commial/experiments) repository on GitHub and the insightful paper [Windows Defender: Demystifying and Bypassing ASR by Understanding the AVS Signatures](https://i.blackhat.com/EU-21/Wednesday/EU-21-Mougey-Windows-Defender-demystifying-and-bypassing-asr-by-understanding-the-avs-signatures.pdf), presented at Black Hat Europe 2021. His work and research have significantly aided our understanding of various aspects of antivirus signatures and provided deep insights into the workings of Windows Defender signatures.

- **GitHubâ€”taviso/loadlibrary**: A special thanks to Tavis Ormandy's repository [loadlibrary] (https://github.com/taviso/loadlibrary) on GitHub. This repository provided great insights into Microsoft Defender and was an entry point for reversing `msmpeng.dll`.

- **Retooling Blog**: We also appreciate the author of the Retooling blog for their detailed article [An Unexpected Journey into Microsoft Defender's Signature World](https://retooling.io/blog/an-unexpected-journey-into-microsoft-defenders-signature-world). Their exploration and documentation of Microsoft Defender's signature mechanisms have been invaluable to this project.

- **Threat Name Definitions**: We acknowledge Microsoft for their detailed [Threat Name Definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/malware-naming?view=o365-worldwide). This documentation has been essential in understanding the malware naming conventions used by Microsoft Defender.

Thank you to all these sources for contributing to the field and sharing their knowledge with the community.
